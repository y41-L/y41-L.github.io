        <p id="explain">Two months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Executive Order 9066 that order all the Japanese-American to evacuate to the West Coast. This caused 120,000 people to evacuate to internment camps in the West

        <p id="explain">In the same year, the U.S. government created questions that question the Japanese-Americans’ royalty to their ancestral land. Those who passed it were allowed to be released from the camps.</p>
